# Pre-work - **Tip Calculator**

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Alexandra Munoz**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added app icon (also changed color of main screen to match icon color)
- [X] Added app icon for spotlight
- [X] Added ability to calculate total amount per person (used UIStepper to allow user to easily increment the number of people in a party and find out how much each person must pay). Minimum amount of people is 1
- [X] Added launch screen 
- [X] Made only text field to enter bill amount visible upon opening the app and the rest of the information is revealed once bill amount is entered

## Notes

I uploaded my original pre-work app to GitHub on December 27th but today (December 29th), when I tried to use GitHub desktop, I attempted to revert one of my submissions and it led to an error in the main storyboard. So I deleted my original repository and created a new one and submitted my new app with improvements.
